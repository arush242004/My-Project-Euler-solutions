Basically all of Problem 2 was one of my friend's code (he's got a non-zero Putnam score). But, to be fair, idk wtf was wrong with me for not getting Problem 2 (I did get as far as trying to apply Fermat's Factoring method though). (Never mind, I got mistaken for Problem 3. Problem 2 is my code.)

Problem 5 was finding the LCM(1, 2,.. 20). So, I got lazy and jut searched the solution up lmao. It was too simple of a problem to even apply my mind to.
